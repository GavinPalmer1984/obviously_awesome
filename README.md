# Introduction
Positioning is the act of deliberately defining how you are the best at something that a defined market cares a lot aobut.
- Want to do better account-based marketing? Get a better understanding of how to identify your best target accounts.
- Want to create better marketing content? Understand your value and differentiators better.
- Want to grow revenue faster? Understand what makes a best-fit customer.

Strong positioning feels like we're cheating.

Effective positioning makes your sales efforts more efficient by attracting customers who are a great fit and who move through a buying process quickly.

# 1. What is Positioning?
## Positioning as Context
The opening scene positions the movie so you can stop wondering about the big questions of where, what, why and who and move onto focusing on the story itself within that context.

Context allows us to make thousands of little decisions about what we should pay attention to and what we can simply ignore.  Without context to guide us, we would be overwhelmed, maybe even paralyzed by choice.

Trap 1: You are stuck on the idea of what you intended to build, and you don't realize that your product has become something else.

## The Five (plus one) Components of Effective Positioning
(Aside: this is where I also first encountered the expression "malicious compliance", meaning you have completed something that was requested of you, simply to illustrate the stupidity of the request.)

There are the Five (Plus One) Components of Effective Positioning:
- Competitive alternatives.  What customers would do if your solution didn't exist.
- Unique attributes.  The features and capabilities that you have and the alternatives lack.
- Value (and proof).  The benefit that those features enable for customers.
- Target market characteristics.  The characteristics of a group of buyers that lead them to really care a lot about the value you deliver.
- Market category.  The market you describe yourself as being part of, to help customers understand your value.
- (Bonus) Relevant trends.  Trends that your target customers understand and/or are interested in that can help make your product more relevant right now.

### 3. Value (and proof)
Value is the benefit you can deliver to customers because of your unique attributes.

Value should be as fact-based as possible.

Your value needs to be provable in an objective and demonstrable way.

### 5. Market category
Declaring that your product exists in a market category triggers a set of powerful assumptions.

Your market category can work for you or against you.

### 6. (Bonus) Relevant trends
Trends can help customers understand why a product is important right now.

AI itself is not a market category and tells customers little about what a product is.  AI-empowered CRM, however, tells us what the product is (CRM is the market category) and gives us a clue about what makes it special right now (the use of AI).

Position your product in a market category that puts your offering's strengthsin their best context, and then look for relevant trends in your industry that can help customers understand why they should consider this product right now.

I've determined that it's critical to start with understanding what the customer sees as a competitive alternative, and then working through the rest of the components - attributes, value, characteristics, market category, relevant trends - from there.

# 2. The 10-Step Positioning Process
## Step 1. Understand the Customers Who Love Your Product
What marketing campaigns brought in the most leads? Which pieces of content were consumed the most?  What events had the most attendees?  Asking these questions led us to the happiest customers.

Until we have more experience with real customers, it's better to keep our minds open and our positioning loose, and see what happens.

Investors will understand that the story in your investor pitch deck may look dramatically different from the story in your sales deck.

In the early days of a company with a single product, positioning the product and the company as the same thing is the easiest path to establishing a brand in the minds of customers, because there are simply fewer things to remember.

## Step 2. Form a Positioning Team
## Step 3. Align Your Positioning Vocabulary and Let Go of Your Positioning Baggage
## Step 4. List Your True Competitive Alternatives
## Step 5. Isolate Your Unique Attributes or Features
## Step 6. Map the Attributes to Value "Themes"
## Step 7. Determine Who Cares a Lot
## Step 8. Find a Market Frame of Reference That Puts Your Strengths at the Center and Determine How to Position in It
## Step 9. Layer On a Trend (but Be Careful)
## Step 10. Capture Your Positioning so It Can Be Shared
# 3. Putting Positioning Into Play
## After Positioning: What Happens Next?
